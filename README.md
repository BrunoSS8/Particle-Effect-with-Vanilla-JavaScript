# Particle Effect with Vanilla JavaScript
 To train the use of Vanilla JavaScript I made an effect on the mouse cursor, when passing the mouse cursor over the screen it releases an effect spreading dots to the whole screen, this effect can be used from a simple aesthetic effect as it can also be used as a generator of cryptographic passwords, since each movement that the user makes with the mouse cursor will be unique and with an infinite number of possibilities of path, and linking this movement to a cryptography we will have a generator of cryptographic keys, together with an aesthetic interactive for the user.
